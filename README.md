This repository includes the books that I read/am reading about data science, machine learning and statistical learning.

The books are:

*The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL)*

Authors: Trevor Hastie/Robert Tibshirani/Jerome Friedman

(ESL) (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman)—was published in 2001, with a second edition in 2009. ESL has become a popular text not only in statistics but also in related fields. One of the reasons for ESL’s popularity is its relatively accessible style. But ESL is intended for individuals with advanced training in the mathematical sciences.

*An Introduction to Statistical Learning*

Authors: Gareth James/Daniela Witten/Trevor Hastie/Robert Tibshirani

This book covers many of the same topics as ESL, but it concentrates more on the applications of the methods and less on the mathematical details. It contains labs illustrating how to implement each of the statistical learning methods using the popular statistical software package R. These labs provide the reader with valuable hands-on experience. This book is appropriate for advanced undergraduates or master’s students in statistics or related quantitative fields or for individuals in other disciplines who wish to use statistical learning tools to analyze their data.
