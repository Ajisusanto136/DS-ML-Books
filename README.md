This repository includes the books about data science, machine learning and statistical methods.

The books are:

*The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL)*

Authors: Trevor Hastie/Robert Tibshirani/Jerome Friedman

This book descibes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting--the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.

*An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R*

Authors: Gareth James/Daniela Witten/Trevor Hastie/Robert Tibshirani

This book provides an introduction to statistical learning methods. It is aimed for upper level undergraduate students, masters students and Ph.D. students in the non-mathematical sciences. The book also contains a number of R labs with detailed explanations on how to implement the various methods in real life settings, and should be a valuable resource for a practicing data scientist.
